We are a team of 2 software engineers trying to make a product called ProxyTel which can serve small businesses to
solve their problems of communication and feedback with their customers.

Basically people are quite hesitant about sharing their actual information specially phone numbers. We map the actual
numbers with proxy numbers to make it secure and easy to setup. We will serve as middle men between the companies and the
Proxy Telephone number provides like Nexmo to take care of all the load balancing needed. Not only that, we can either 
get dedicated proxy numbers depending on your demand and budget or we can have shared pool of proxy numbers to be shared for small businesses. Oh wait, there is more to it. Not only do we make this whole process secure, we also help you get the entire sentiment analysis of the conversations. We have used Watson APIs to extract the sentiment from the communications and
the team can thereby just focus their attention on the critical calls or needs.
